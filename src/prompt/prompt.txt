Hi, my name is Marc White and I am 31 years old and live in Highland Park, IL. I enjoy digital photography and bicycling while spending time outdoors with the family. I have previously visited Spain, Italy, Albania, Greece, and Mexico and enjoyed them all very much for their diverse culture. I would like to find somewhere new to travel with the family which includes 2 adults and 2 children (1 year old and 3 year old) while experiencing unique attractions and events.
