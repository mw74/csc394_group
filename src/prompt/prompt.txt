Hi, my name is Bob Villa and I am 31 years old and live in Highland Park, IL. I enjoy digital photography and bicycling while spending time outdoors with the family. I have previously visited Spain, Italy, Albania, Greece, and Mexico and enjoyed them all very much for their diverse culture. I would like to find somewhere new to travel with the family while experiencing unique attractions and events.
